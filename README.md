# Project 1

# Tech Used
The project centered around using JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and HTML to build a website that provides information about the developer.

# Approach Used
-Inittialy the concept was to have a splash page that would have multiple links to other pages with similar or identical formatting and CSS. Mobile formatting was preferred, but not completed. Though there is a function to allow clicking instead of hovering when below a certain pixel count.
-During development, it was decided to shift to single site with more jQuery functionality. This site uses hide, show, slideUp/Down methods to "simulate" page loads while keeping the user on one URL.
-The site required a homepage, bio, resume, and projects competed/TBD.

# Unsolved Problems
-Dropdown menu upper right is not working as intended. It was supposed to slide down when hovering over it, but the 
-Mobile formatting is missing for the most part. 
-Bottom navbar floats above other elements under most conditions. 
-Fonts are stock, needs more variety/design
